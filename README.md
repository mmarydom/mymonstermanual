# Project Details

- If you are choosing Option 1:

  Do not save over your first version! Duplicate the project and starting adding from there. FAILURE TO DO THIS WILL RESULT IN A GRADE REDUCTION.
  Additionally, you will be expected to add more JavaScript features given that you are starting from an existing project.

- Two javascript libraries implemented in project 2:
  - p5.js
  - create.js
